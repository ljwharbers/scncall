# medicc2.R
# What: export of the tumour-mode clone copy-number states (clone_segments / clones / assignments of a caller run)
#       as MEDICC2 input: common pieces over all clones, one haplotype convention per piece across clones
#       (block orientation by a reference clone's pooled votes), and the MEDICC2 TSV (allele-specific or total).
# Why: every clone's `state` (major:minor) is oriented by its own pseudobulk, so major / minor do not name the same
#      haplotype across clones. MEDICC2's allele-specific mode treats cn_a / cn_b as fixed haplotypes; two clones that
#      lost opposite haplotypes must get swapped cn_a / cn_b, and two that lost the same one identical values.
# Inputs: segments, clones and assignments tables of a tumour run (vignette("scncall-outputs", package = "scncall")), the run's molecule votes
#         and atoms (scn_features). Outputs: data.tables (pieces, orientation QC, block orientation, MEDICC2 table).

#' Common copy-number pieces of the clones of a tumour run (MEDICC2 export, step 1)
#'
#' Drops doublet clones, clones with fewer than `min_assigned` assigned cells and clones without segments; builds the
#' union of the remaining clones' segment breakpoints ([segment_pieces()]) on `chroms`, maps every clone's state to
#' every piece (segment containing the piece midpoint, as `piece_states()`) and keeps the pieces covered by every kept
#' clone (gaps of any clone, e.g. missing windows or a clone-specific chromosome start, are dropped). Pieces shorter
#' than `min_len` are then absorbed into an adjacent piece of the same chromosome (gap <= `max_gap`): the neighbour
#' whose states differ in the fewest clones, the longer one on ties; the neighbour keeps its states and extends over
#' the short piece. A short piece without an eligible neighbour is dropped. Adjacent pieces with identical states are
#' not merged here: merging needs the common haplotype orientation and is done by [medicc2_table()].
#' @param segments segments table (`clone, chrom, start, end, state, cn, label, ploidy`; `nA, nB, f` optional)
#' @param clones clones table (`clone`, `doublet`, `n_assigned`); NULL keeps every clone of `segments`
#' @param min_len pieces shorter than this (bp) are absorbed into a neighbour
#' @param max_gap maximal gap (bp) between a short piece and the neighbour it is absorbed into
#' @param min_assigned clones with fewer assigned cells are dropped (the normal clone `normal` is always kept)
#' @param chroms chromosomes exported (MEDICC2: chr1-22 and chrX)
#' @param normal name of the normal clone
#' @return long data.table, one row per clone x piece: `piece` (`seg|all|chrom:start-end`), `chrom`, `start`, `end`,
#'   `clone`, `state`, `major`, `minor`, `cn`, `label`, `ploidy`, `imbalanced` (major != minor on a diploid piece; these
#'   need orientation), `seg_nA`, `seg_nB`, `seg_f` (the containing segment's pooled votes in the clone's own
#'   orientation, NA when absent). Attributes `clones_dropped` (clone, reason) and `pieces_dropped` (chrom, start, end,
#'   reason: `not_all_clones` / `short_isolated`) and `n_pieces_raw` (pieces before the coverage filter).

#' Common haplotype orientation of clone states per piece (MEDICC2 export, step 2)
#'
#' Per piece, a reference clone is chosen among the clones with an imbalanced state (major != minor on a diploid
#' piece): the clone with the largest expected orientation signal `a * |major / cn - 0.5| * sqrt(n)`, where `a` is
#' the clone's allelic attenuation (`clones$a`, 1 when missing) and `n` its pooled votes on the piece. Each phase block
#' (piece x phase set) is oriented by the sign of the reference clone's pooled votes (A - B; ties and blocks without
#' reference votes are left unoriented and do not count). Every clone's votes on the oriented blocks are pooled into
#' an oriented fraction `f`: the fraction of the reference clone's major haplotype. The convention is cn_a = the
#' reference clone's major haplotype; a clone with an imbalanced state gets `cn_a = major, cn_b = minor` when
#' `f >= 0.5`, else the swap. Balanced states (n:n, 0:0) and haploid pieces (male chrX, ploidy 1) pass through as
#' `cn_a = major, cn_b = minor`.
#'
#' Chaining (`chain`): which haplotype of a piece is called "a" is arbitrary (only the relation between clones is
#' measured), but MEDICC2 counts an event over adjacent pieces once only when the label is continuous. Walking along
#' each chromosome, a piece's labels are flipped as a whole (cn_a <-> cn_b in every clone, `f` -> 1 - `f`, block signs
#' negated) when, relative to the previous piece, (`parsimony`) more confidently oriented clones (`ok` / `ref`)
#' change direction (sign of cn_a - cn_b) than keep it (clones in the same state in both pieces count 1, others 0.5),
#' or (`phase`) the phase sets shared by the two pieces say that the previous piece's cn_a haplotype is this piece's
#' cn_b (sum over shared blocks of the product of the two reference signs, weighted by min(|nA_ref - nB_ref|); used
#' when the weights sum to >= `min_link` votes). The other rule is the fallback when the first has no evidence.
#' `parsimony` is the default: a single long phase block straddling a piece boundary with a phase switch inside it
#' can link the two halves of one clonal loss with opposite labels. Pieces after a chromosome
#' start or next to a piece without imbalanced clones are not chained. Flipping never changes which clones share a
#' haplotype within a piece.
#'
#' Cells pooled per clone (`use`): `confident` (default) takes the cells confidently assigned to the clone (posterior at least
#' `min_post`, not doublet-like), close to the pseudobulk members that produced the clone states, without the
#' mixed / uncertain cells whose votes would pull `f` towards 0.5; `assigned` takes the `assigned` column. The
#' reference clone orients its blocks with its own votes, so its own `f` is biased upwards (sign reliable, magnitude
#' not; `is_ref` marks these rows). Orientation errors of the reference on blocks with few votes attenuate the other
#' clones' `f` towards 0.5 but do not flip it; a clone whose oriented `f` is within `near` of 0.5 despite an imbalanced
#' state is flagged `low_conf` (its cn_a / cn_b assignment is a guess).

#'     `ref_votes`, `n_swapped`, `n_low_conf`.
#'   - `blocks`: the reference orientation per block, reusable by a per-cell module: one row per piece x phase set

#'     (+1: phase-set haplotype A is cn_a; -1: haplotype B is cn_a; 0: tie, unoriented). Blocks absent from the table
#'     are unoriented. A cell's oriented votes on a piece are `a = sum(sign > 0 ? nA : nB)`, `b = sum(sign > 0 ? nB :

#' MEDICC2 input table (MEDICC2 export, step 3)
#'
#' One row per sample x segment with integer copy numbers capped at `cap`: `sample_id, chrom, start, end, cn_a, cn_b`
#' (allele-specific) or `sample_id, chrom, start, end, cn` (total = cn_a + cn_b, for `--total-copy-numbers
#' --input-allele-columns cn`). Adjacent pieces of a chromosome whose values are identical in every sample are merged
#' (after the cap; on cn_a / cn_b, or on cn for the total table), so every sample has the same segments, as MEDICC2
#' requires. The normal clone `normal` is a sample (MEDICC2 `--normal-name N0`); when absent it is added as 1:1 on
#' diploid and 1:0 on haploid pieces (male chrX), so it is the root of the tree. Chromosomes are sorted naturally.
#' @param x [orient_clone_states()] result, or a long table with `clone, chrom, start, end, cn_a, cn_b` (+ `ploidy`)
#' @param allele_specific TRUE: cn_a / cn_b columns; FALSE: total cn
#' @param normal name of the normal sample
#' @param cap maximal copy number (MEDICC2 caps at 8)
#' @param chroms chromosomes kept
#' @return data.table (MEDICC2 TSV layout); attribute `n_pieces` (pieces before merging)
